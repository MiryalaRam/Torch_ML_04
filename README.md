#Hand Gesture Recognition Model
This repository houses a gesture recognition model developed to accurately identify and classify various hand gestures from live feed. Leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model can recognize gestures in real time.

#Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Gesture-Recognition-Model.git
cd Gesture-Recognition-Model

#Dataset
The model was trained on a custom dataset containing labeled hand gesture images. You can create your own dataset or use publicly available datasets for hand gestures.

#Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for gesture recognition consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. You can find the details in the model.py file.
